\label{appendix:testenv}

All the test we presented were carried out in a protected environment, in order
to avoid performance fluctuation due to system load. A 8 GB RAM machine running
ArchLinux has been prepared, with a idle memory usage of 300 MB (base system and
OpenSSH server). The processor is an Intel i5-6200U, 2 core and 4 threads due to
HyperThreading, with a processor base frequency of 2.30 GHz. The Linux processor
scheduler is ondemand. We noticed in our tests possible thermal throttling, that
should not affect general performances.
